# risk-management-metrics-curated

A curated list of useful and relevant resources for eschewing common-but-flawed approaches and pitfalls of risk management and metrics and decision-making.

If you have a resource that you think should be here, fork it and submit a PR! Will review and integrate if it looks good.

And things to challenge assertions like:
> "We can't do accurate forecasting in security because we don't have data!"

(you know more than you think)

> "We don't have a methodology now (so decisions are arbitrary), so *any* methodology is better than no methodology!"

(bad methodologies lead to bad decisions - and worse - overconfidence in those bad decisions)
